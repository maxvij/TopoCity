# Welcome to the TopoCity repository!
Thanks for testing our application! This is how you can launch the application on your local computer: <br>

## Installation
To be able to run the application, Python 3.8 or higher should be installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/). In order to compile the code, you need NodeJS ([https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)). We recommend using the Node Package Manager (npm).
<br>

### Clone the repository
Clone this repository using the following command in a Git bash <br>
```git clone https://github.com/maxvij/TopoCity.git```

### Run the API
1.  From the current folder (in which you cloned the project), go to <br>```cd /api``` 
2. Install the requirements: <br> ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run <br> ```flask run ```

### Run React
1. **Open a new terminal window**. Go to the /client folder <br> ```cd /client```
2. Run <br> ```npm install```
3. Run <br> ```npm start```

### Have fun
React should automatically open up a new browser tab, otherwise go to
http://localhost:3000/ in the browser. <br> There is no need to send us the results, as long as you are connected to the internet, your data will be in safe hands (ours). <br>
Thanks for contributing to our research üôè
