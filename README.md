# Welcome to the TopoCity repository!
Thanks for testing our application! This is how you can launch the application on your local computer: <br>

## Installation
To be able to run the application, you need:
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
<br>

### Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/maxvij/TopoCity.git```

### Run the API

2. Install the requirements: <br> ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
