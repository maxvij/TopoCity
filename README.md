# How to use Git

- First you clone the github directory into your computer somewhere with: 
	- git clone "repository link"
- If you want the latest version to start editing you go to your github directory in your own system and type: 
	- git pull
- When you edited a file you perform these three commands:
	- git add -A
	- git commit -am "mention what you changed between these quotes so we see what you did"
	- git push
